 Interactivity:
 - if the green switch button is clicked, the lights go out and a discobal appears
 - if a key is pressed while the lights are out, discomusic starts playing
 - if you click the red switch button, the lights go on and the discomusic stops 
 - the instruments make music if you click them and different kinds of music notes appear
 - if you click on the instruments again or on another instrument, the music stops and the music notes disappear
 
 For the program to work, the library "Sound" has to be added
 (Sketch-button on the top of the navigation bar in processing, Import Library, Add Library, Sound (Provides a simple way to work with audio.))
